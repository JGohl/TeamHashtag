Trend Analysis of Recent Twitter #Hashtags 
Data Analytics Boot Camp Project 1
Adam Zimmerman, James Holland, Joshua Gohlike

Proposal: We will be doing an analysis of three recent twitter hashtags to draw conclusions about user demographic and location trends, as well as hashtag performance over time. Specifically:

Is there a relationship between user age and the use of hashtags?
What can user location tell us about these hashtag trends?
How have these hashtags trended in frequency over time?
Is there a relationship between hashtag usage and time of day?

We will attempt to answer these questions for the following hashtags between 2015 and June 2018:
#WalkOut
#Metoo
#FakeNews

Data source: To answer these questions, we will be exploring twitter APIs to gather the necessary data.

Anticipated tasks:
Develop systems for:
    productive meetings
    effective project management 
    optimal use of collaborative technology (GitHub, google docs) 
Explore data sets available through twitter APIs
Develop code to collect data through APIs
Develop code to explore and clean data
Develop code to format and analyze data
Graph data and format for meaningful interpretation
For presentation, develop a narrative that draws connections between research questions and data analysis and visuals
