Data Analytics Boot Camp Project 1
Adam Zimmerman, James Holland, Joshua Gohlike

Proposal: Using data made accessible via FiveThirtyEight, we will be conducting an analysis on a sampling of 3 million bot tweets connected to the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Specifically: 

    From which regions were the tweets orginiating?
    What kind of tweets were the bots retweeting?
    How many followers did the bots have when they tweeted?
    How many other twitter users were the bots following?

Data source: To answer these questions, we will be using data sets available on the FiveThirtyEight github repository here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets 

Anticipated tasks:

Develop systems for:
    productive meetings
    effective project management 
    optimal use of collaborative technology (GitHub, google docs) 
Explore data sets available
Develop code to collect data through APIs
Develop code to explore and clean data
Develop code to format and analyze data
Graph data and format for meaningful interpretation
For presentation, develop a narrative that draws connections between research questions and data analysis and visuals
